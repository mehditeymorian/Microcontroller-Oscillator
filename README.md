# Microcontroller-Oscillator
An Microcontroller based Oscillator that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. I used Stm32f microcontroller to complete this project. You can generate up to 8 different types of waves. Also Wave period and frequency are adjustable.

# Wave types
- Sine Wave
- Square Wave
- Triangle Wave
- Sawtooth Wave
- Stair Wave
- Rectified Sine Wave
- Vertically Segmented Sine Wave
- Sine Modulation of Square Wave
