# Microcontroller-Oscillator
An Microcontroller based Oscillator that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. I used Stm32f microcontroller to complete this project. You can generate up to 8 different types of waves. Also Wave period and frequency are adjustable.

## Domain and Freuqnecy
You can adjust the domain from scale 4 to 10 which 10 being the highest and the bigest size. and the frequency is adjustable from 1hz to 20kHz.
