# Microcontroller-Oscillator
A Microcontroller based Oscillator that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave. I used Stm32f microcontroller to complete this project. You can generate up to 8 different types of waves. Also Wave period and frequency are adjustable. You can find the complete report [here](https://github.com/mehditeymorian/Microcontroller-Oscillator/blob/master/Assets/report.pdf).

## How It Works
Microcontroller generate PWM and change its duty cycle frequently to shape the right wave. afterward, PWM goes through a LCF type T and then a LCF type L to clear the noises. Finally we have a nice and smooth wave. üòÅ

## Wave Types
- Sine Wave
- Square Wave
- Triangle Wave
- Sawtooth Wave
- Stair Wave (12)
- Rectified Sine Wave (14)
- Vertically Segmented Sine Wave (17)
- Sine Modulation of Square Wave (18)

## Domain and Freuqnecy
You can adjust the domain from scale 4 to 10 which 10 being the highest and the bigest size. and the frequency is adjustable from 1hz to 20kHz.

### How to Run
load the hex file into the microcontroller in proteus file. set 96 and 97 for amilitude and frequency respectively in proteus file. and hit the run button.
